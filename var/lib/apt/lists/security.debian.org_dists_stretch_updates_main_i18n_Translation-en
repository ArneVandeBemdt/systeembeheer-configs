 beep does what you'd expect: it beeps. But unlike printf "\a" beep allows
 you to control pitch, duration, and repetitions. Its job is to live inside
 shell/perl scripts and allow more granularity than one has otherwise. It is
 controlled completely through command line options. It's not supposed to be
 complex, and it isn't - but it makes system monitoring (or whatever else it
 gets hacked into) much more informative.

Package: cvs
Description-md5: 62e6daa6a4968f3b8a09c5e8724afc0c
Description-en: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep access
 to old versions  of files (usually source code), keep a log of
 who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.
 It handles multiple developers, multiple directories, triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations, and can work over a wide
 area network. The texinfo manual provides further information on
 more tasks that it can perform.
 .
 There are some tasks that are not covered by CVS. They can be done in
 conjunction with CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and
 software other than CVS. These tasks are bug-tracking, build management
 (that is, make and make-like tools), and automated testing. However,
 CVS makes these tasks easier.
 .

Package: dbus
Description-md5: 8317e43242716ec7f7692a3ac5895e1c
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Package: dbus-user-session
Description-md5: be4453093922af92deac14b4e8458a83
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .

 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Description-en: manage files with git, without checking their contents into git
 git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
 contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
 dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
 to limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
 .
 It can store large files in many places, from local hard drives, to a
 large number of cloud storage services, including S3, WebDAV,
 and rsync, with a dozen cloud storage providers usable via plugins.
 Files can be stored encrypted with gpg, so that the cloud storage
 provider cannot see your data. git-annex keeps track of where each file
 is stored, so it knows how many copies are available, and has many
 facilities to ensure your data is preserved.
 .
 git-annex can also be used to keep a folder in sync between computers,
 noticing when files are changed, and automatically committing them
 to git and transferring them to other computers. The git-annex webapp
 makes it easy to set up and use git-annex this way.

Package: gnupg1
Description-md5: fec79c5a1d50bbd1be7b3af2be9ce2f3
Description-en: GNU privacy guard - a PGP implementation (deprecated "classic" version)
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 The gnupg1 package provides GnuPG 1.4, the "classic" standalone,
 non-modularized version. It is provided mainly for people with the
 need to use archaic cryptographic objects like PGPv3 keys to access
 archived messages.  It does not support more recent cryptographic
 primitives like ECDSA or EdDSA.  Please use the gnupg package instead
 unless you know for sure that you need gnupg1.
 .
 The gnupg1 package is built without libcurl to minimize dependencies,
 so it does not support HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg1-curl
 package if you want to use the keyserver helper tools built with
 libcurl and supporting HKPS.

Package: gnupg1-curl

 which replace the ones in the gnupg1 package built with the "curl
 shim" variant of gnupg1. This package provides support for HKPS
 keyservers.
 .
 Since gnupg1 is deprecated in Debian, it is recommended that you use
 the gnupg package instead, and rely on the "dirmngr" package for
 network access.  dirmngr can do everything that gnupg1-curl can do,
 and more.

 different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to
 make the signature are trustworthy.
 .

 HKP/HKPS keyservers, or from LDAP servers.  For X.509 this includes
 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status
 Protocol updates (OCSP).  It is capable of using tor for network
 access.
 .
 dirmngr is used for network access by gpg, gpgsm, and dirmngr-client,
 among other tools.

 This is GnuPG's signature verification tool, gpgv, built statically
 so that it can be directly used on any platform that is running on
 the Linux kernel.  Android and ChromeOS are two well known examples,
 but there are many other platforms that this will work for, like
 embedded Linux OSes.  This gpgv in combination with debootstrap and
 the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot
 installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature

Package: golang-1.7
Description-md5: 8650a23f44e2d60a785ad3123733d6d8
Description-en: Go programming language compiler - metapackage
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees
 that (most of) a full Go development environment is installed.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.
 .
 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

Description-en: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support development files
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
 implementation called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been
 split into separate packages.

 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications. This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the Gtk+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).

 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

 Plink (PuTTY Link) connects to a remote system via SSH, Telnet, or rlogin,
 and either starts an interactive session or runs a batch process. It
 supports the usual SSH features like port forwarding, X11 forwarding,
 SOCKS, and compression.
 .
 PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy) transfers files securely between systems using an
 SSH connection. It works with both SSH protocol 1 and protocol 2.
 .
 PSFTP (PuTTY SFTP client) transfers files securely between systems using
 the SSH file transfer protocol, which is specific to SSH protocol 2. In
 interactive mode its interface is much like the traditional Unix FTP
 client, although it can also operate in batch mode.
 .
 PuTTYgen generates SSH public and private key pairs in any of a number of
 formats, including those usable by PuTTY, OpenSSH, and ssh.com.
 .
 All these utilities can make use of PuTTY's saved sessions where
 appropriate.

 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: tmpreaper
Description-md5: a0e82c31f2d9aee95c0f41d6cc0557b2
Description-en: cleans up files in directories based on their age
 This package provides a program that can be used to clean out temporary-file
 directories.  It recursively searches the directory, refusing to chdir()
 across symlinks, and removes files that haven't been accessed in a
 user-specified amount of time.  You can specify a set of files to protect
 from deletion with a shell pattern.  It will not remove files owned by the
 process EUID that have the `w' bit clear, unless you ask it to, much like
 `rm -f'.  `tmpreaper' will not remove symlinks, sockets, fifos, or special
 files unless given a command line option enabling it to.
 .
 WARNING:  Please do not run `tmpreaper' on `/'.  There are no protections
 against this written into the program, as that would prevent it from
 functioning the way you'd expect it to in a `chroot(8)' environment.
 .
 The daily tmpreaper run can be configured through /etc/tmpreaper.conf .

Package: libtcnative-1
Description-md5: e84963f196d386a9d69b251a5bf67a6e
Description-en: Tomcat native library using the Apache Portable Runtime
 Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability,
 performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
 The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the
 heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to
 advanced IO functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level
 functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native
 process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
 .
 These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will
 enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and
 overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform
 rather than simply a backend focused technology.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Description-en: fast, self-healing application container server (core)
 uWSGI presents a complete stack for networked/clustered web applications,
 implementing message/object passing, caching, RPC and process management.
 It uses the uwsgi protocol for all the networking/interprocess communications.
 .
 uWSGI can be run in preforking, threaded, asynchronous/evented modes and
 supports various forms of green threads/coroutines (such as uGreen, Greenlet,
 Fiber). uWSGI provides several methods of configuration: via command line,
 via environment variables, via XML, INI, YAML configuration files, via LDAP
 and more.
 .
 On top of all this, it is designed to be fully modular. This means that
 different plugins can be used in order to add compatibility with tons of
 different technology on top of the same core.

Description-md5: 63a4a740bcd9e8e94bf661e4f1806e02

 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Package: wordpress-shibboleth
Description-md5: 3fa0375bc92730a73ad684b68f0d327b
Description-en: Shibboleth plugin for WordPress
 This plugin is designed to support integrating your WordPress blog into
 your existing identity management infrastructure using a Shibboleth
 Service Provider.
 .
 WordPress can be configured so that all standard login requests will be
 sent to your configured Shibboleth Identity Provider or Discovery Service.
 Upon successful authentication, a new WordPress account will be
 automatically provisioned for the user if one does not already exist.
 User attributes (username, first name, last name, display name, nickname,
 and email address) can be synchronized with your enterprise's system of
 record each time the user logs into WordPress.
 .
 Finally, the user's role within WordPress can be automatically set (and
 continually updated) based on any attribute Shibboleth provides. For
 example, you may decide to give users with an eduPersonAffiliation value
 of faculty the WordPress role of editor, while the eduPersonAffiliation
 value of student maps to the WordPress role contributor. Or you may choose
 to limit access to WordPress altogether using a special
 eduPersonEntitlement value.

 that acts as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers. All of the visible
 rendering is passed to the back-end X servers. Clients connect to the Xdmx
 front-end, and everything appears as it would in a regular multi-head
 configuration. If Xinerama is enabled (e.g., with +xinerama on the command
 line), the clients see a single large screen.

 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.

 znc is an IRC proxy. It runs as a daemon and connects to IRC server,
 then allows you to connect from a workstation and work as the user that
 is logged in to the IRC server. After you disconnect, it maintains the
 connection to the server. It acts like any normal IRC server, so you can
 use any IRC client to connect to it.
 .
 Some of its features include support for multiple users, multiple clients,
 and multiple IRC servers; playback buffers to catch up with what happened
 while you were detached, SSL encryption, DCC proxying, and a plugin
 interface with many plugins supporting other features.
