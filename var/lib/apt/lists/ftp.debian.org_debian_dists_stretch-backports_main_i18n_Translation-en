Package: acmetool
Description-md5: 3e5e145ae880b97f3b6e825daf35ce32
Description-en: automatic certificate acquisition tool for Let's Encrypt
 acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically
 acquiring TLS certificates from ACME (Automated Certificate Management
 Environment) servers such as Let's Encrypt, designed to flexibly
 integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic verification.
 .
 acmetool is designed to work like make: you specify what certificates
 you want, and acmetool obtains certificates as necessary to satisfy
 those requirements. If the requirements are already satisfied,
 acmetool doesn't do anything when invoked. Thus, acmetool is
 ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will do nothing until
 certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.
 .
 acmetool is designed to minimise the use of state and be transparent
 in the state that it does use. All state, including certificates, is
 stored in a single directory, by default /var/lib/acme. The schema
 for this directory is simple, comprehensible and documented.

Description-en: caching proxy server for software repositories
 Apt-Cacher NG is a caching proxy for downloading packages from Debian-style
 software repositories (or possibly from other types).
 .
 The main principle is that a central machine hosts the proxy for a local
 network, and clients configure their APT setup to download through it.
 Apt-Cacher NG keeps a copy of all useful data that passes through it, and when
 a similar request is made, the cached copy of the data is delivered without
 being re-downloaded.
 .
 Apt-Cacher NG has been designed from scratch as a replacement for
 apt-cacher, but with a focus on maximizing throughput with low system
 resource requirements. It can also be used as replacement for apt-proxy and
 approx with no need to modify clients' sources.list files.

Package: biboumi
Description-md5: 479d7434bd03973bbda4b1be59f8e98d
Description-en: XMPP gateway to connect to IRC servers
 Biboumi is an XMPP gateway that connects to IRC servers and translates
 between the two protocols. It can be used to access IRC channels using
 any XMPP client as if these channels were XMPP MUCs.
 .
 It is written in modern C++14 and makes great efforts to have as little
 dependencies and to be as simple as possible.
 .
 The goal is to provide a way to access most of IRC features using any
 XMPP client.  It doesn’t however try to provide a complete mapping of
 the features of both worlds simply because this is not useful and most
 probably impossible.  For example all IRC modes are not all
 translatable into an XMPP features.  Some of them are (like +m (mute)
 or +o (operator) modes), but some others are IRC-specific.  If IRC is
 the limiting factor (for example you cannot have a non-ASCII nickname
 on IRC) then biboumi doesn’t try to work around this issue: it just
 enforces the rules of the IRC server by telling the user that he/she
 must choose an ASCII-only nickname.  An important goal is to keep the
 software (and its code) light and simple.

Description-md5: 677f2a00e31e316c282b8bf13f2fbe19
Description-en: build log hardening check
 Perl tool which checks build logs for missing hardening
 flags. Hardening flags enable additional security features in the
 compiler to prevent e.g. stack overflows, format string
 vulnerabilities, GOT overwrites, etc. See e.g.
 <http://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags>.
 .
 Because most build systems are quite complicated there are many
 places where compiler flags from the environment might be ignored.
 The parser verifies that all compiler commands use the correct
 hardening flags and thus all hardening features are correctly used.
 .
 It's designed to check build logs generated by Debian's
 dpkg-buildpackage (or tools using dpkg-buildpackage like pbuilder or
 the official buildd build logs) to help maintainers detect missing
 hardening flags in their packages.

 BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed to
 isolate essential kernels of computation that, when optimized, immediately
 enable optimized implementations of most of its commonly used and
 computationally intensive operations. BLIS is written in ISO C99 and available
 under a new/modified/3-clause BSD license. While BLIS exports a new BLAS-like
 API, it also includes a BLAS compatibility layer which gives application
 developers access to BLIS implementations via traditional BLAS routine calls.
 An object-based API is also available for more experienced users.
 .
 The package contains the serial version of development files.

Description-en: metapackage for the BOINC client and the manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 This package depends both on the BOINC core client program that is
 required to participate in any project that uses BOINC, and the
 BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and control utility for the
 BOINC core client.

 .
 This package contains the BOINC core client program that is required
 to participate in any project that uses BOINC. A central server
 distributes work units and collects results via this client. When
 attaching a local machine to a project, this client will also
 dynamically download the scientific data and executables to be then
 wrapped by the BOINC core client.

Description-en: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
  * attached projects
  * running tasks
  * file transfers between the client and project servers
  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
  * constraints on CPU usage
 The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
 it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
 in which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.

Description-en: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

  * Containers support stateful allocators and are compatible with
    Boost.Interprocess (they can be safely placed in shared memory).
  * The library offers new useful containers:
    * flat_map, flat_set, flat_multimap and flat_multiset: drop-in
      replacements for standard associative containers but more
      memory friendly and with faster searches.
    * stable_vector: a std::list and std::vector hybrid container:
      vector-like random-access iterators and list-like iterator
      stability in insertions and erasures.
    * slist: the classic pre-standard singly linked list implementation
      offering constant-time size(). Note that C++11 forward_list has no size().

 Boost.Fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers)

 Each fiber has its own stack.

 A fiber can save the current execution state, including all registers
 and CPU flags, the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and
 later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple execution
 paths running on a single thread using cooperative scheduling (versus
 threads, which are preemptively scheduled). The running fiber decides
 explicitly when it should yield to allow another fiber to run
 (context switching). Boost.Fiber internally uses execution_context
 from Boost.Context; the classes in this library manage, schedule and,
 when needed, synchronize those execution contexts. A context switch
 between threads usually costs thousands of CPU cycles on x86,
 compared to a fiber switch with less than a hundred cycles. A fiber
 runs on a single thread at any point in time.

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 This library aims to make logging significantly easier for the
 application developer. It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box
 tools along with public interfaces for extending the library. The
 main goals of the library are:
 .
  * Simplicity. A small example code snippet should be enough to get
 the feel of the library and be ready to use its basic features.
  * Extensibility. A user should be able to extend functionality of the
 library for collecting and storing information into logs.
  * Performance. The library should have as little performance impact on
 the user's application as possible.

Description-en: deduplicating and compressing backup program
 Borg is a deduplicating and compressing backup program. Optionally, it
 also supports authenticated encryption. It was forked from the attic
 backup program.
 .
 The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
 backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
 for daily backups since only the changes are stored. The authenticated
 encryption makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted targets.
 .
 It can push backups to remote repositories accessed via ssh. A client
 pushing a backup invokes "borg serve" on the repository host. It is
 possible to restrict the ssh key to "borg serve" using the
 authorized_keys command= clause.
 .
 Please note that the server and the client should be on the same
 version of borgbackup. Using different versions of borgbackup on
 client and server might result in 'incompatible API version' error
 messages and a non-working backup.
 .
 While there is no direct operations mode for pull-type backups, you
 can configure the backup target in append-only mode, preventing the
 backup source from deleting or altering previous backups.

Package: chiark-really
Description-md5: 9709e7755f9784c63272a8109e99e67b
Description-en: really - a tool for gaining privilege (simple, realistic sudo)
 really is a program that allows certain users to become whatever user
 they like on request.  It is a bit like sudo in that respect.
 However, really is simpler than sudo, and doesn't give the system
 administrator any false security promises.  So really is less of a
 general security risk to the system.
 .
 Unlike sudo it does not pretend that the called account can be any
 more secure than the calling account, so there is never a need for a
 password.  If you wanted to restrict which commands and functions the
 called user can perform, use userv, not really or sudo.
 .
 Also unlike sudo, really only works if the calling user is supposed
 to be equivalent to root.  But, really can also be used by
 root-equivalent users to become any user, not just root; in this way
 it can be a replacement for certain uses of su.

Description-md5: 9bb162e0cc542877672e43a15da10cd8
Description-en: virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers
 Darktable manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view
 them  through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw
 images and enhance them.
 .
 It tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free
 raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).
 The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and
 mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact,
 even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.
 .
 All editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image
 buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export. The
 frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image
 loading is done using rawspeed, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats
 such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates completely on floating
 point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for
 scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).

 Deft is an Emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing
 directories of plain text notes, inspired by Notational Velocity.
 .
 It was designed for increased productivity when writing and taking
 notes, by making it fast and simple to find the right file at the
 right time, and by automating many of the usual tasks such as
 creating new files and saving files.

Package: dehydrated
Description-md5: c09902462a0a5f656bb0a6b7c2847ea9
Description-en: ACME client implemented in Bash
 The dehydrated ACME client allows signing certificates with an
 ACME server, like the one provided by the Let’s Encrypt certificate
 authority (letsencrypt.org).  It is implemented as a relatively simple
 Bash script, which uses curl to communicate with the ACME server and
 OpenSSL to deal with keys, sign requests and certificates.
 .
 The ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol makes
 it possible to automatically obtain browser-trusted certificate.

Package: dehydrated-apache2
Description-md5: 2abf97dfda95b9574d67e1247ae21509
Description-en: dehydrated challenge response support for Apache2
 This package provides an Apache2 config snippet to serve the http-01 challenge
 responses for dehydrated.
 .
 Installing this package together with dehydrated is enough to have a fully
 functional ACME client, including replying to the HTTP challenge.

Package: dehydrated-hook-ddns-tsig
Description-md5: 8418fa8d1d3d7c0777249b3697f18836
Description-en: dehydrated dns-01 challenge response support
 This package provides a hook script to serve dns-01 challenge responses for
 dehydrated.
 .
 It uses the dnspython API to perform dynamic DNS updates, creating a temporary
 TXT record for the given domain, thereby proving ownership of the domain.
 It requires a DNS-server capable of performing dynamic DNS updates, like bind9.
 There is no need for the DNS-server to run on the local machine.
 .
 This is useful if you want to create ACME certificates for servers that do not
 serve HTTP and/or are not exposed to the public internet.
 Another important use case are wildcard certificates.

Package: detox
Description-md5: 57a56ea30e81ef29e23165136cbfe243
Description-en: replace problematic characters in filenames
 detox is a utility designed to clean up filenames. It replaces difficult to
 work with characters, such as spaces, with standard equivalents. It will also
 clean up filenames with UTF-8 or Latin-1 (or CP-1252) characters in them.
 .
 Features:
  * Removal or replacement of upper ASCII Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) characters;
  * Removal or replacement of UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters;
  * Removal or replacement of spaces and other potentially tricky characters;
  * Trimming of excessive "_" and "-"s;
  * Directory recursion, dry runs, verbose listings.
 .
 It is designed with safety in mind. It won't overwrite a file that already
 exists, and it doesn't touch special files if not requested.
 .
 detox is useful to mass rename files automatically. As just one example,
 you can use detox to easily standardize lots of files, as MP3 or movies,
 downloaded or stored inside a directory.
 .
 This package provides detox and inline-detox commands. The inline-detox can
 be used in command lines, as a filter in shell procedures.

Package: devscripts
Description-md5: 2c4a42c80e5dee33dd86b7661c2041c0
Description-en: scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier
 Contains the following scripts, dependencies/recommendations shown in
 brackets afterwards:
 .
  - annotate-output: run a command and prepend time and stream (O for stdout,
    E for stderr) for every line of output.
  - archpath: Prints arch (tla/Bazaar) package names. Also supports
    calculating the package names for other branches. [tla | bazaar]
  - bts: A command-line tool for accessing the Debian Bug Tracking System, both
    to send mails to control@bts.debian.org and to access the web pages and
    SOAP interface of the BTS. [www-browser, libauthen-sasl-perl,
    libnet-smtps-perl, libsoap-lite-perl, liburi-perl, libwww-perl,
    bsd-mailx | mailx]
  - build-rdeps: Searches for all packages that build-depend on a given package.
    [dctrl-tools, dose-extra, libdpkg-perl]
  - chdist: tool to easily play with several distributions. [dctrl-tools]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
    bash-specific constructs.
  - cowpoke: upload a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and build it,
    optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue.
    [ssh-client]
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrappers around debi and debc respectively (see below)
    which allow them to be called from the CVS working directory.
    [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: wrapper around debrelease which allows it to be called
    from the CVS working directory. [cvs-buildpackage, dupload | dput,
    ssh-client]
  - cvs-debuild: A wrapper for cvs-buildpackage to use debuild as its package
    building program. [cvs-buildpackage, fakeroot, lintian, gnupg |gnupg2]
  - dcmd: run a given command replacing the name of a .changes or .dsc file
    with each of the files referenced therein. *
  - dcontrol: remotely query package and source control files for all Debian
    distributions. [liburl-perl, libwww-perl]
  - dd-list: given a list of packages, pretty-print it ordered by maintainer. *
  - debc: List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful
    "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.
  - debchange (abbreviation dch): Modifies debian/changelog and manages version
    numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an
    entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to it.
    [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*
  - debcheckout: checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *
  - debclean: Clean a Debian source tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian
    source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove
    all files that were generated from these source trees (that is .deb, .dsc
    and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though,
    so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary.
    [fakeroot]*
  - debcommit: Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg,
    using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports
    tagging Debian package releases. [cvs | darcs | subversion | svk | tla |
    bzr | git-core | mercurial, libtimedate-perl]
  - debdiff: A program which examines two .deb files or two .changes files and
    reports on any difference found in their file lists.  Useful for ensuring
    that no files were inadvertently lost between versions.  Can also examine
    two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions.
    For a deeper comparison one can use the diffoscope package.
    [wdiff, patchutils]*
  - debdiff-apply: Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as
    those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes
    to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that
    changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. May be used to check
    that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages.
    [python3-debian, python3-unidiff, quilt]
  - debi: Installs the current package by using the setuid root debpkg
    script described below.  It assumes that the current package has
    just been built (for example by debuild), and the .deb lives in the
    parent directory, and will effectively run dpkg -i on the .deb.  The
    ability to install the package with a very short command is very
    useful when troubleshooting packages.
  - debpkg: A wrapper for dpkg used by debi to allow convenient testing
    of packages.  For debpkg to work, it needs to be made setuid root,
    and this needs to be performed by the sysadmin -- it is not
    installed as setuid root by default.  (Note that being able to run a
    setuid root debpkg is effectively the same as having root access to
    the system, so this should be done with caution.)  Having debpkg as
    a wrapper for dpkg can be a Good Thing (TM), as it decreases the
    potential for damage by accidental wrong use of commands in
    superuser mode (e.g., an inadvertent rm -rf * in the wrong directory
    is disastrous as many can attest to).
  - debrelease: A wrapper around dupload or dput which figures out which
    version to upload, and then calls dupload or dput to actually perform
    the upload. [dupload | dput, ssh-client]
  - debrepro: A script that tests reproducibility of Debian packages. It will
    build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the
    first and second build, and compare the binary packages produced. If
    diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If
    disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject
    non-determinism in filesystem listing operations.
    [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]
  - debrsign: This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for
    signing, and runs debsign on the remote machine over an SSH connection.
    [gnupg | gnupg2, debian-keyring, ssh-client]
  - debsign: Use GNU Privacy Guard to sign the changes (and possibly dsc)
    files created by running dpkg-buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful
    if you are building a package on a remote machine and wish to sign it on
    a local one.  This script is capable of automatically downloading the
    .changes and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg |gnupg2,
    debian-keyring, ssh-client]*
  - debsnap: grab packages from https://snapshot.debian.org [libwww-perl,
    libjson-perl]
  - debuild: A wrapper for building a package (i.e., dpkg-buildpackage) to
    avoid problems with insufficient permissions and wrong paths etc.
    Debuild will set up the proper environment for building a package.
    Debuild will use the fakeroot program to build the package by default, but
    can be instructed to use any other gain-root command, or can even be
    installed setuid root.  Debuild can also be used to run various of
    the debian/rules operations with the same root-gaining procedure.
    Debuild will also run lintian to check that the package does not
    have any major policy violations. [fakeroot, lintian, gnupg | gnupg2]*
  - deb-reversion: increases a binary package version number and repacks the
    package, useful for porters and the like.

    .dsc to download all references files. Specify a package name to download
    it from the configured apt repository. [wget | curl]
  - diff2patches: extracts patches from a .diff.gz file placing them under
    debian/ or, if present, debian/patches. [patchutils]
  - dpkg-depcheck, dpkg-genbuilddeps: Runs a specified command (such as
    debian/rules build) or dpkg-buildpackage, respectively, to determine the
    packages used during the build process.  This information can be helpful
    when trying to determine the packages needed in the Build-Depends etc.

    checkout. Also supports calculating the paths for branches and
    tags in a repository independent fashion. Used by debcommit to generate
    svn tags. [subversion]
  - tagpending: runs from a Debian source tree and tags bugs that are to be
    closed in the latest changelog as pending. [libsoap-lite-perl]
  - transition-check: Check a list of source packages for involvement in
    transitions for which uploads to unstable are currently blocked.
    [libwww-perl, libyaml-syck-perl]
  - uscan: Automatically scan for and download upstream updates.  Uscan can
    also call a program such as uupdate to attempt to update the Debianised
    version based on the new update.  Whilst uscan could be used to release
    the updated version automatically, it is probably better not to without
    testing it first.  Uscan can also verify detached OpenPGP signatures if
    upstream's signing key is known. [file, gpgv | gpgv2, gnupg | gnupg2,
    libfile-which-perl, liblwp-protocol-https-perl, libmoo-perl, libwww-perl,
    unzip, xz-utils]*
  - uupdate: Update the package with an archive or patches from

Description-en: read/write encrypted BitLocker volumes
 Dislocker has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions under
 a Linux system. The driver used to read volumes encrypted in Windows system
 versions of the Vista to 10 and BitLocker-To-Go encrypted partitions,that's
 USB/FAT32 partitions.
 .
 The software works with driver composed of a library, with multiple binaries
 using this library. Decrypting the partition, you have to give it a mount
 point where, once keys are decrypted, a file named dislocker-file appears.
 This file is a virtual NTFS partition, so you can mount it as any NTFS
 partition and then read from or write to it. Writing to the NTFS virtual
 file will change the underlying BitLocker partition content.
 .
 This tool is useful in cryptography managing and forensics investigations.

Package: python3-django-sass-processor
Description-md5: 96b6180322445d29bfa234c7e7553514
Description-en: compile files from markup languages such as SASS/SCSS
 django-sass-processor converts *.scss or *.sass files into *.css
 while rendering templates. For performance reasons this is done only
 once, since the preprocessor keeps track on the timestamps and only
 recompiles, if any of the imported SASS/SCSS files is younger than
 the corresponding generated CSS file.
 .
 This Django app provides a templatetag {% sass_src
 'path/to/file.scss' %}, which can be used instead of the built-in
 templatetag static. Since version 0.3.4 this also works for Jinja2
 templates.
 .
 If SASS/SCSS files shall be referenced through the Media class, or
 media property, the SASS processor can be used directly.
 .
 Additionally, django-sass-processor is shipped with a management
 command, which can convert the content of all occurrences inside the
 templatetag sass_src as an offline operation. Hence the libsass
 compiler is not required in a production environment.
 .
 During development, a `sourcemap <https://developer.chrome.com=""
 devtools="" docs="" css-preprocessors="">`__ is generated along side
 with the compiled *.css file. This allows to debug style sheet errors
 much easier.
 .
 With this tool, you can safely remove your Ruby installations
 "Compass" and "SASS" from your Django projects. You neither need any
 directory "watching" daemons based on node.js.

Package: driverctl
Description-md5: 678c88cccbe6b9b83f574bceee4c4530
Description-en: Device driver control utility for Linux
 Driverctl is a tool for manipulating and inspecting the system
 device driver choices.
 .
 Devices are normally assigned to their sole designated kernel driver
 by default. However in some situations it may be desirable to
 override that default, for example to try an older driver to
 work around a regression in a driver or to try an experimental alternative
 driver. Another common use-case is pass-through drivers and driver
 stubs to allow userspace to drive the device, such as in case of
 virtualization.
 .
 driverctl integrates with udev to support overriding
 driver selection for both cold- and hotplugged devices from the
 moment of discovery, but can also change already assigned drivers,
 assuming they are not in use by the system. The driver overrides
 created by driverctl are persistent across system reboots
 by default.

Package: erlang-luerl
Description-md5: ba0442956c0172294ab501db8dfd5616
Description-en: implementation of Lua in Erlang
 An experimental implementation of Lua 5.2 written solely in pure Erlang
 .
 When to use Luerl:
 .
 Fast Language Switch: Luerl should allow you to switch between Erlang and Lua
 incredibly fast, introducing a way to use very small bits of logic programmed
 in Lua, inside an Erlang application, with good performance.
 .
 Multicore: Luerl provides a way to transparently utilize multicores. The
 underlying Erlang VM takes care of the distribution.
 .
 Microprocesses: It should give you a Lua environment that allows you to
 effortlessly run tens of thousands of Lua processes in parallel, leveraging
 the famed microprocesses implementation of the Erlang VM. The empty Luerl
 State footprint will be yet smaller than the C Lua State footprint.
 .
 Forking Up: Because of the immutable nature of the Luerl VM, it becomes a
 natural operation to use the same Lua State as a starting point for multiple
 parallel calculations.
 .
 However, Luerl will generally run slower than a reasonable native Lua
 implementation. This is mainly due the emulation of mutable data on top of an
 immutable world. There is really no way around this. An alternative would be
 to implement a special Lua memory outside of the normal Erlang, but this would
 defeat the purpose of Luerl. It would instead be then more logical to connect
 to a native Lua.
 .
 Some valid use cases for Luerl are:
  * Lua code will be run only occasionally and it wouldn't be worth managing
    an extra language implementation in the application;
  * the Lua code chunks are small so the slower speed is weighed up by Luerl's
    faster interface;
  * the Lua code calculates and reads variables more than changing them;
  * the same Lua State is repeatedly used to 'fork up' as a basis for
    massively many parallel calculations, based on the same state;
  * it is easy to run multiple instances of Luerl which could better utilise
    multicores.

Package: erlang-p1-pkix
Description-md5: 17490bcd12287b68f22b6961bdae9b3c
Description-en: PKIX certificates management library for Erlang
 The idea of the library is to simplify certificates configuration in Erlang
 programs. Typically an Erlang program which needs certificates  (for HTTPS/
 MQTT/XMPP/etc) provides a bunch of options such as certfile,  chainfile,
 privkey, etc. The situation becomes even more complicated when a  server
 supports so called virtual domains because a program is typically  required to
 match a virtual domain with its certificate. If a user has plenty  of virtual
 domains it's quickly becoming a nightmare for them to configure all this.
 The complexity also leads to errors: a single configuration mistake and a
 program generates obscure log messages, unreadable Erlang tracebacks or,
 even worse, just silently ignores the errors.
 Fortunately, the large part of certificates configuration can be automated,
 reducing a user configuration to something as simple as:
 .
 certfiles:
   - /etc/letsencrypt/live/*/*.pem
 .
 The purpose of this library is to do this dirty job under the hood.

Description-en: Erlang/Elixir XMPP parsing and serialization library
 This library provides comprehensive representation of XMPP elements as
 well as tools to work with them. Every such element is represented by an
 Erlang record. Most of the library's code is auto generated and thus
 considered to be bug free and efficient.
 .
 The approach is very similar to ASN.1, Google Protocol Buffers or Apache
 Thrift: an XML element is transformed into internal language structure
 (an Erlang record in this case) - the process known as "decoding". During
 decoding, validation is also performed, thus well-typed structures are
 generated, potentially decreasing bugs related to handcrafted parsing. A
 reverse process known as "encoding" is applied for transforming an
 Erlang record into an XML element.
 .
 This package should be used along with erlang-p1-xml, because it is
 only able to decode from and encode to structures generated by that
 library (that is, xmlel() elements).

Description-en: configuration for the Exim MTA (v4)
 Exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. exim4-config provides the configuration
 for the exim4 daemon packages. The configuration framework has been split
 off the main package to allow sites to replace the configuration scheme
 with their own without having to change the actual exim4 packages.
 .
 Sites with special configuration needs (having a lot of identically
 configured machines for example) can use this to distribute their own
 custom configuration via the packaging system, using the magic
 available with dpkg's conffile handling, without having to do local
 changes on all of these machines.

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Package: flent
Description-md5: ac992f5a1b2fd770a6100e803f1403f5
Description-en: FLExible Network Tester for bufferbloat testing and more
 The FLExible Network Tester: Python wrapper to run multiple simultaneous
 netperf/iperf/ping instances and aggregate the results.
 .
 Tests are specified as config files (which are really Python), and
 various parsers for tool output are supplied. At the moment, parsers for
 netperf in -D mode, iperf in csv mode and ping/ping6 in -D mode are
 supplied, as well as a generic parser for commands that just outputs a
 single number.
 .
 Several commands can be run in parallel and, provided they output
 timestamped values, (which netperf ping and iperf do, the latter with a
 small patch, available in the misc/ directory), the test data points can
 be aligned with each other in time, interpolating differences between
 the actual measurement points. This makes it possible to graph (e.g.)
 ping times before, during and after a link is loaded.

Package: git-cvs
Description-md5: 5c201c3115375a8b8f735f8e7775526c
Description-en: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (cvs interoperability)
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git cvsimport, cvsexportcommit, and cvsserver
 tools, which allow Git to read from and write to CVS repositories and
 offer access over CVS protocol to Git repositories.
 .
 The git cvsimport tool can incrementally import from a repository that
 is being actively developed and only requires remote access over CVS
 protocol. Unfortunately, in many situations the import leads to
 incorrect results. For reliable, one-shot imports, cvs2git from the
 cvs2svn package or parsecvs may be a better fit.

Package: git-annex
Description-md5: ed39e4e4c2d1afd0f4612868aabeeec0
Description-en: manage files with git, without checking their contents into git
 git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
 contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
 dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
 to limitations in memory, time, or disk space.
 .
 It can store large files in many places, from local hard drives, to a
 large number of cloud storage services, including S3, WebDAV,
 and rsync, with a dozen cloud storage providers usable via plugins.
 Files can be stored encrypted with gpg, so that the cloud storage
 provider cannot see your data. git-annex keeps track of where each file
 is stored, so it knows how many copies are available, and has many
 facilities to ensure your data is preserved.
 .
 git-annex can also be used to keep a folder in sync between computers,
 noticing when files are changed, and automatically committing them
 to git and transferring them to other computers. The git-annex webapp
 makes it easy to set up and use git-annex this way.

Description-md5: 606237586cd533eed7972349938eab1e
Description-en: HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across multiple go-routines
 Package autorest implements an HTTP request pipeline suitable for use across
 multiple go-routines and provides the shared routines relied on by AutoRest
 (see https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) generated Go code.
 .
 The package breaks sending and responding to HTTP requests into three phases:
 Preparing, Sending, and Responding.
 .
 Each phase relies on decorators to modify and / or manage processing.
 Decorators may first modify and then pass the data along, pass the data first
 and then modify the result, or wrap themselves around passing the data (such as
 a logger might do). Decorators run in the order provided.
 .
 Preparers and Responders may be shared and re-used (assuming the underlying
 decorators support sharing and re-use). Performant use is obtained by creating
 one or more Preparers and Responders shared among multiple go-routines, and a
 single Sender shared among multiple sending go-routines, all bound together by
 means of input / output channels.
 .
 Decorators hold their passed state within a closure (such as the path
 components in the example above). Be careful to share Preparers and Responders
 only in a context where such held state applies. For example, it may not make
 sense to share a Preparer that applies a query string from a fixed set of
 values. Similarly, sharing a Responder that reads the response body into a
 passed struct (e.g., ByUnmarshallingJson) is likely incorrect.
 .
 Lastly, the Swagger specification (https://swagger.io) that drives AutoRest
 (https://github.com/Azure/autorest/) precisely defines two date forms: date and
 date-time. The github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/date package provides
 time.Time derivations to ensure correct parsing and formatting.
 .
 Errors raised by autorest objects and methods will conform to the
 autorest.Error interface.

Package: golang-github-google-go-cmp-dev
Description-md5: a570016be8c1a78ee8634131254d0f7f
Description-en: Package for comparing Go values in tests
 This package is intended to be a more powerful and safer alternative to
 reflect.DeepEqual for comparing whether two values are semantically equal.
 .
 The primary features of cmp are:
  * When the default behavior of equality does not suit the needs of the test,
    custom equality functions can override the equality operation.  For
    example, an equality function may report floats as equal so long as they
    are within some tolerance of each other.
  * Types that have an Equal method may use that method to determine equality.
    This allows package authors to determine the equality operation for the
    types that they define.
  * If no custom equality functions are used and no Equal method is defined,
    equality is determined by recursively comparing the primitive kinds on both
    values, much like reflect.DeepEqual. Unlike reflect.DeepEqual, unexported
    fields are not compared by default; they result in panics unless suppressed
    by using an Ignore option (see cmpopts.IgnoreUnexported) or explicitly
    compared using the AllowUnexported option.
 .

Package: golang-github-hashicorp-errwrap-dev
Description-md5: 8f9ccf8319716d5c9b3fe6b07ffaa505
Description-en: Errwrap is a Go (golang) library for wrapping and querying errors
 errwrap is a package for Go that formalizes the pattern of wrapping errors and
 checking if an error contains another error.
 .
 There is a common pattern in Go of taking a returned error value and then
 wrapping it (such as with fmt.Errorf) before returning it. The problem with
 this pattern is that you completely lose the original error structure.
 .
 Arguably the correct approach is that you should make a custom structure
 implementing the error interface, and have the original error as a field on
 that structure, such as this example. This is a good approach, but you have to
 know the entire chain of possible rewrapping that happens, when you might just
 care about one.
 .
 errwrap formalizes this pattern (it doesn't matter what approach you use above)
 by giving a single interface for wrapping errors, checking if a specific error
 is wrapped, and extracting that error.
 .

Description-md5: b875e52b0f5b6e3a76d700941fa09b3e
Description-en: Golang package for gossip based membership and failure detection
 memberlist is a Go library that manages cluster membership and member failure
 detection using a gossip based protocol.
 .
 The use cases for such a library are far-reaching: all distributed systems
 require membership, and memberlist is a re-usable solution to managing cluster
 membership and node failure detection.
 .
 memberlist is eventually consistent but converges quickly on average. The speed
 at which it converges can be heavily tuned via various knobs on the protocol.
 Node failures are detected and network partitions are partially tolerated by
 attempting to communicate to potentially dead nodes through multiple routes.

 KCP (golang-github-xtaci-kcp-dev) is a Production-Grade Reliable-UDP
 library for golang. It provides fast, ordered, and error-checked delivery
 of stream over UDP packets.
 .
 It has been well tested with opensource project kcptun, which runs on
 millions of devices, from low-end MIPS routers to high-end servers. It also
 runs well for applications like online games, live broadcasting, file
 synchronization and network acceleration.
 .
 Features:
   * Optimized for Realtime Multiplayer Games, Audio/Video Streaming.
   * Compatible with skywind3000's (https://github.com/skywind3000)
     C version with optimizations.
   * Cache friendly and Memory optimized design in golang.
   * Compatible with net.Conn (https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn)
     and net.Listener (https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listener).
   * FEC (Forward Error Correction)
     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction)
     Support with Reed-Solomon Codes

 .
 Conventions:
   Control messages like SYN/FIN/RST in TCP are not defined in KCP.
   You need some keepalive/heartbeat mechanims in the application-level.
   A real world example is to use some multiplexing protocol over session,
   such as smux (golang-github-xtaci-smux-dev) with embedded keepalive
   mechanism. See kcptun (https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun) for example.

Package: golang-x-text-dev
Description-md5: b5329026b7ea6fb8504d8bc7bee08454
Description-en: Transitional package for golang-golang-x-text-dev

Package: golang-gopkg-yaml.v2-dev
Description-md5: 6e824756f0591b8ea6b6af832141a3c8
Description-en: YAML support for the Go language
 The yaml package enables Go programs to very comfortably encode and
 decode YAML values. It was developed within Canonical as part of the
 juju project, and is based on a pure Go port of the well-known libyaml
 C library to parse and generate YAML data quickly and reliably.
 .
 The yaml package supports most of YAML 1.1 and 1.2, including support for
 anchors, tags, map merging, etc. Multi-document unmarshalling is not yet
 implemented, and base-60 floats from YAML 1.1 are purposefully not supported
 since they're a poor design and are gone in YAML 1.2.
 .
 This package is an incompatible successor to golang-goyaml
 ("gonuts.org/v1/yaml", and then renamed to "gopkg.in/yaml.v1").

Description-en: Google's framework for writing and using C++ mock classes
 NOTE: This is a transitional package, retained for backwards compatibility.
 New code should instead use either package libgmock-dev (for compiled lib)
 or package googletest (for lib sources).

Package: googletest
Description-md5: 1e437b718f57755079100bb08186b2de
Description-en: Google's C++ test framework sources
 This package provides sources for Google Test and Google Mock.
 .
 Google Test is a framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of
 platforms. Based on the xUnit architecture. Supports automatic test
 discovery, a rich set of assertions, user-defined assertions, death
 tests, fatal and non-fatal failures, value- and type-parameterized
 tests, various options for running the tests, and XML test report
 generation.
 .
 Google Mock is an extension of Google Test for C++ mocking.  Inspired
 by jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with C++'s specifics
 in mind, it can help you derive better designs of your system and
 write better tests.
 .
 Google Mock:
 .
  - provides a declarative syntax for defining mocks,
  - can easily define partial (hybrid) mocks, which are a cross of real
    and mock objects,
  - handles functions of arbitrary types and overloaded functions,
  - comes with a rich set of matchers for validating function arguments,
  - uses an intuitive syntax for controlling the behavior of a mock,
  - does automatic verification of expectations (no record-and-replay
    needed),
  - allows arbitrary (partial) ordering constraints on
    function calls to be expressed,
  - lets a user extend it by defining new matchers and actions.
  - does not use exceptions, and
  - is easy to learn and use.
 .
 NOTE: This package does not contain a library to link against, but rather
 the source code to build the google test and mock libraries.  This enables
 building the google test and mock libraries with the same flags as the
 C++ code under test.

Package: gpsprune
Description-md5: 4cd2b69a33c05e4615249da27b877da9
Description-en: visualize, edit, convert and prune GPS data
 GpsPrune is an application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate
 data from GPS systems. It's a tool for preparing GPS data before you go on a
 trip, and for playing with your collected GPS data after you get home again.
 .
 It can load data from arbitrary text-based formats (for example, any
 tab-separated or comma-separated file) or XML, or directly from a GPS
 receiver. It can display the data (as map view using OpenStreetMap
 images and as altitude profile), edit this data (for example delete
 points and ranges, sort waypoints, compress tracks), and save the data
 (in various text-based formats). It can also export data as a GPX
 file, or as KML/KMZ for import into Google Earth, or send it to a GPS
 receiver.
 .
 Some example uses of GpsPrune include cleaning up tracks by deleting
 wayward points - either recorded by error or by unintended detours. It
 can also be used to compare and combine tracks, convert to and from
 various formats, compress tracks, export data to Google Earth, or to
 analyse data to calculate distances, altitudes and so on.
 .
 Furthermore, GpsPrune is able to display the tracks in 3d format and
 lets you spin the model round to look at it from various directions.
 You can also export the model in POV format so that you can render a
 nice picture using Povray. You can also create charts of altitudes or
 speeds. It can also load Jpegs and read their coordinates from the
 EXIF tags, and export thumbnails of these photos to Kmz format so that
 they appear as popups in Google Earth. If your photos don't have
 coordinates yet, GpsPrune can be used to connect them (either manually or
 automatically using the photo timestamps) to data points, and write
 these coordinates into the EXIF tags.

Package: grep
Description-md5: f9188c5583d41955f3b3fe60b9d445f1
Description-en: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description-md5: 95a283ed5766101c57cbbde0d1b67a66
Description-en: Funny turn-based artillery game, featuring fighting hedgehogs!
 Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the
 course of the game, players take turns with one of their
 hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are
 available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby
 winning the game. Hedgehogs may move around the terrain in a
 variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by
 using particular tools such as the "Rope" or "Parachute", to
 move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited
 to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive
 thinking or moving.
 .
 A large variety of tools and weapons are available for players
 during the game: Grenade, Cluster Bomb, Bazooka, UFO, Homing Bee,
 Shotgun, Desert Eagle, Fire Punch, Baseball Bat, Dynamite, Mine,
 Rope, Pneumatic pick, Parachute. Most weapons, when used, cause
 explosions that deform the terrain, removing circular chunks.
 The landscape is an island floating on a body of water, or a
 restricted cave with water at the bottom. A hedgehog dies when
 it enters the water (either by falling off the island, or
 through a hole in the bottom of it), it is thrown off either
 side of the arena or when its health is reduced, typically from
 contact with explosions, to zero (the damage dealt to the
 attacked hedgehog or hedgehogs after a player's or CPU turn is
 shown only when all movement on the battlefield has ceased).

 parser designed for easy reusability, which can for instance be used in
 higher level language bindings for efficient reply parsing.

Package: printer-driver-hpijs
Description-md5: a4e5debc05f7a32d2cd372505ee6118a
Description-en: HP Linux Printing and Imaging - printer driver (hpijs)
 This package contains an IJS printer driver for Ghostscript, which
 adds support for most inkjet printers and some LaserJet printers
 manufactured by HP.  It is also required for HPLIP fax support.
 .
 The Debian package of hpijs includes the so-called rss patch, to use
 pure black ink instead of composite black in printers that don't do
 color map conversion in firmware.
 .
 HPIJS can take advantage of Ghostscript IJS KRGB support when
 available, to enhance black printing on printers that do color
 map conversion in firmware and are thus not affected by the old
 rss patch.
 .
 Users of the CUPS printing system are advised to also install the
 hplip package, and use the hp CUPS backend to send data to the printer.
 HPLIP supports USB, networked and parallel-port devices, and enables
 extended HPIJS functionality such as border-less printing.
 Selecting any hpijs ppd in CUPS will use hpijs automatically.
 .
 HPIJS is meant to be used through the foomatic system (see the
 foomatic-filters package or foomatic-rip in the cups-filters package).

Description-md5: b448f81acc1e180c8aea8788f156d555
Description-en: fast, standards compliant, C based, HTML 5 parser for python
 A fast implementation of the HTML 5 parsing spec for Python. Parsing is
 done in C using a variant of the gumbo parser. The gumbo parse tree is
 then transformed into an lxml tree, also in C, yielding parse times that
 can be a thirtieth of the html5lib parse times. That is a speedup of 30x.
 This differs, for instance, from the gumbo python bindings, where the
 initial parsing is done in C but the transformation into the final
 tree is done in python.

 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  * Encryption - no one else can read your instant messages.
  * Authentication - you are assured the correspondent is who you think
    it is.
  * Deniability - the messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures
    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you. However,
    _during_ a conversation, correspondents are assured the messages
    they see are authentic and unmodified.
  * Forward secrecy - if you lose control of your private keys,
    no previous conversation is compromised.

Package: jdupes
Description-md5: c39c2d10a5bfd8aedad8944d3ef07d4f
Description-en: identify and delete or link duplicate files
 jdupes is a program based in fdupes. The main goal of jdupes is identify
 and taking actions upon duplicate files. In comparison with fdupes, jdupes
 is heavily modified from and improved.
 .
 The biggest reason to use jdupes is raw speed. In testing on various data
 sets, jdupes is over 7 times faster than fdupes-1.51 on average.
 .
 Code in jdupes is written with data loss avoidance as the highest priority.
 If a choice must be made between being aggressive or careful, the careful
 way is always chosen.
 .
 jdupes includes features that are not found in fdupes. Examples of such
 features include btrfs block-level deduplication and control over which
 file is kept when a match set is automatically deleted. jdupes is not
 afraid of dropping features of low value; a prime example is the -1 switch
 which outputs all matches in a set on one line, a feature which was found
 to be useless in real-world tests and therefore thrown out.
 .
 jdupes can convert duplicate files in hardlinks or relative softlinks. It
 is useful in several scenarios, as in Debian packaging, to create relative
 symlinks to lots of duplicate files (it will substitute rdfind + symlinks
 commands, used to same purpose, when solving lintian duplicate-files).
 .
 Packages build for Linux versions have support to btrfs filesystem.

Package: jellyfish1

Description-en: count k-mers in DNA sequences
 JELLYFISH is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in
 DNA. A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences
 of all such substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA
 sequence. JELLYFISH can count k-mers using an order of magnitude less
 memory and an order of magnitude faster than other k-mer counting
 packages by using an efficient encoding of a hash table and by
 exploiting the "compare-and-swap" CPU instruction to increase
 parallelism.
 .
 JELLYFISH is a command-line program that reads FASTA and multi-FASTA
 files containing DNA sequences. It outputs its k-mer counts in an
 binary format, which can be translated into a human-readable text
 format using the "jellyfish dump" command.
 .
 This is the latest version of the 1.x series of jellyfish which is
 used by some other applications that are not compatible with version
 2.x which is provided inside the jellyfish package.

Description-en: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django
 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and an optional
 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Package: joe-jupp

 using the jupp package and implementation (both binaries and manpages).
 It also contains the appropriate conffiles and, in contrast to Debian's
 joe flavour, supports SELinux context copying (on Debian systems with
 the Linux kernel), and has many bugs fixed and makes some of jupps new
 features available to the joe, jstar, jmacs, jpico and rjoe flavours.

Package: jupp
Description-md5: 758a80f0d3a3d8d4d242d368cca88861
Description-en: user friendly full screen text editor
 Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has eight help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 Joe has a great screen update optimisation algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection
 menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, block move, copy, delete or filter, a
 bracketed paste mode automatically enabled on xterm-xfree86 and decimal
 and hexadecimal gotos for lines, columns, and file offsets.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete imitation
 of WordStar in non-document mode, and a restricted mode version (lets you
 edit only the files specified on the command line). Joe also has a deferred
 screen update to handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not
 bypassed by tty buffering. It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work
 on any kind of sane terminal. Furthermore, it supports SELinux context
 copying on Debian systems with the Linux kernel.
 .
 This version of JOE only comes with the Jupp flavour, to not conflict
 with the Debian joe package, activated. The resource files and executable
 links and menu entries for the other flavours are still available, though,
 in the joe-jupp package.

Package: kbuild
Description-md5: a6a88ec57452f04f777c23642a30d83d

 The goals of the kBuild framework:
  - Similar behavior cross all supported platforms.
  - Flexibility, don't create unnecessary restrictions preventing ad-hoc
    solutions.
  - Makefile can very simple to write and maintain.
 .
 There are four concepts being tried out in the current kBuild incaration:
  - One configuration file for a subtree automatically included.
  - Target configuration templates as the primary mechanism for makefile
    simplification.
  - Tools and SDKs for helping out the templates with flexibility.
  - Non-recursive makefile method by using sub-makefiles.
 .
 kBuild does not provide any facilities for checking compiler/library/header
 configurations, that's not in its scope. If this is important for your
 project, check out the autoconf tool in the GNU build system. It is possible
 to use kBuild together with autoconf if you like, but you might just as well
 use the full GNU package.

Package: kraken
Description-md5: 4dc49da345dc88dcd656d9a30393ce7e
Description-en: assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences
 Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA
 sequences, usually obtained through metagenomic studies. Previous
 attempts by other bioinformatics software to accomplish this task have
 often used sequence alignment or machine learning techniques that were
 quite slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but much faster
 abundance estimation programs. Kraken aims to achieve high sensitivity
 and high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel
 classification algorithm.
 .
 In its fastest mode of operation, for a simulated metagenome of 100 bp
 reads, Kraken processed over 4 million reads per minute on a single
 core, over 900 times faster than Megablast and over 11 times faster than
 the abundance estimation program MetaPhlAn. Kraken's accuracy is
 comparable with Megablast, with slightly lower sensitivity and very high
 precision.

Description-md5: e9837a11b3f558a9827bd1f70164a326
Description-en: edlib sequence alignment tool using edit distance
 Edlib is a lightweight and super fast C/C++ library for sequence
 alignment using edit distance.  This package provides an aligner
 using this library.
 .
 Features of libedlib
 .
  * Calculates edit distance (Levehnstein distance).
  * It can find optimal alignment path (instructions how to transform
    first sequence into the second sequence).
  * It can find just the start and/or end locations of alignment path -
    can be useful when speed is more important than having exact
    alignment path.
  * Supports multiple alignment methods: global(NW), prefix(SHW) and
    infix(HW), each of them useful for different scenarios.
  * You can extend character equality definition, enabling you to e.g.
    have wildcard characters, to have case insensitive alignment or to
    work with degenerate nucleotides.
  * It can easily handle small or very large sequences, even when finding
    alignment path, while consuming very little memory.
  * Super fast thanks to Myers's bit-vector algorithm.

Description-en: async fingerprint library of fprint project, development headers
 The fprint project aims to support for consumer fingerprint reader devices.
 .
 Previously, Linux support for such devices has been scattered amongst different
 projects (many incomplete) and inconsistent in that application developers
 would have to implement support for each type of fingerprint reader separately.
 The idea is to change that by providing a central system to support all the
 fingerprint readers as it's possible to get hands on.

 talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing fingerprint data.
 .
 This library depends on the new libusb, which performs asynchronous callbacks,
 allowing fprint to perform non-blocking device tasks.

Description-md5: 38798c1111c8d672cb29734a4221bae1
Description-en: Perl module to log messages safely and efficiently
 Log::Any allows CPAN modules to safely and efficiently log messages, while
 letting the application choose (or decline to choose) a logging mechanism
 such as Log::Dispatch or Log::Log4perl.
 .
 Log::Any has a very tiny footprint and no dependencies beyond Perl 5.6, which
 makes it appropriate for even small CPAN modules to use. It defaults to
 'null' logging activity, so a module can safely log without worrying about
 whether the application has chosen (or will ever choose) a logging mechanism.
 .
 The application, in turn, may choose one or more logging mechanisms via
 Log::Any::Adapter.

Description-md5: 42c1d0b6aeb68e5586482de4937a9e25
Description-en: Reliable Event Logging Protocol (RELP) library - development files
 RELP provides reliable event logging over the network.
 .
 RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when
 connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current version of
 RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a
 session has been broken due to network problems. In this case, a few messages
 may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp syslog). Future
 versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.
 .
 Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. Even
 though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog
 communication, RELP supports many more applications. Extensible command verbs
 provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing
 applications.

Description-md5: 572bda75c4098ae418d449838338c41c
Description-en: asynchronous event notification library - development files
 Libuv is the asynchronous library behind Node.js. Very similar to libevent or
 libev, it provides the main elements for event driven systems: watching and
 waiting for availability in a set of sockets, and some other events like timers
 or asynchronous messages. However, libuv also comes with some other extras
 like:
  * files watchers and asynchronous operations
  * a portable TCP and UDP API, as well as asynchronous DNS resolution
  * processes and threads management, and a portable inter-process
    communications mechanism, with pipes and work queues
  * a plugins mechanism for loading libraries dynamically
  * interface with external libraries that also need to access the I/O.
 .
 Install this package if you wish to develop your own programs using the
 libuv engine.

Description-en: kernel module to memory dump (DKMS)
 LiME (Linux Memory Extractor, formerly DMD) is a Loadable Kernel
 Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory (RAM)
 from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as those powered by Android.
 In others words, you can use it to get a memory image from a machine.
 .
 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.
 .
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

 wireless attach points and ad hoc networks.
 .
 A table is displayed with various parameters such as MAC address, channel,
 and signal strength. Graphs are also displayed with signal strength by
 channel and signal strength over time.
 .
 LinSSID is graphically and functionally similar to inSSIDer (for Microsoft
 Windows) and Wifi Analyzer (for Android).
 .
 LinSSID can be used to measure the local performance or to search for an
 interference free channel to be set in a wireless router (access point or
 AP). The wireless established link won't be affected by these operations
 because LinSSID needn't set the monitor mode in network interface.
 .
 Some features:
 .
   - Table of locally receivable attach points with many columns of different
     information and sortable and movable columns.
   - Adjustable speed, real-time update.
   - Graphs of signal strength by channel and over time.
   - AP bandwidth displayed.

Package: libfuzzer-5.0-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Description-md5: e971ae25bca86cd8f4914ecf62f6301c
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC or many other architectures.

 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).

 This package provides tools for testing.

 Magic is a venerable VLSI layout tool, written in the 1980's at Berkeley by
 John Ousterhout, now famous primarily for writing the scripting interpreter
 language Tcl. Due largely in part to its liberal Berkeley open-source license,
 magic has remained popular with universities and small companies. The
 open-source license has allowed VLSI engineers with a bent toward programming
 to implement clever ideas and help magic stay abreast of fabrication
 technology. However, it is the well thought-out core algorithms which lend to
 magic the greatest part of its popularity. Magic is widely cited as being the
 easiest tool to use for circuit layout, even for people who ultimately rely on
 commercial tools for their product design flow.

Description-md5: 64209b154f8fd44d07ae89f7ec71745a
Description-en: Metadata anonymisation toolkit v2
 Metadata consist of information that characterizes data. Metadata are
 used to provide documentation for data products. In essence, metadata
 answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about every facet of the
 data that are being documented.
 .
 Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data
 about when a picture was taken and what camera was used. Office
 documents like PDF or Office automatically adds author and company
 information to documents and spreadsheets.
 .
 Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.
 .
 MAT2 only removes metadata from your files, it does not anonymise their
 content, nor can it handle watermarking, steganography, or any too
 custom metadata field/system.
 .
 If you really want to be anonymous, use file formats that do not contain
 any metadata, or better: use plain-text.
 .
 Formats supported to some extent are:
    - Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
    - JPEG (.jpeg, .jpg, ...)
    - Open Document (.odt, .odx, .ods, ...)
    - Office Openxml (.docx, .pptx, .xlsx, ...)

Package: minimap2
Description-md5: f1022cbd2c265b138702b6677abf3e99
Description-en: versatile pairwise aligner for genomic and spliced nucleotide sequences
 Minimap2 is a versatile sequence alignment program that aligns DNA or
 mRNA sequences against a large reference database. Typical use cases
 include: (1) mapping PacBio or Oxford Nanopore genomic reads to the
 human genome; (2) finding overlaps between long reads with error rate up
 to ~15%; (3) splice-aware alignment of PacBio Iso-Seq or Nanopore cDNA
 or Direct RNA reads against a reference genome; (4) aligning Illumina
 single- or paired-end reads; (5) assembly-to-assembly alignment; (6) full-
 genome alignment between two closely related species with divergence
 below ~15%.
 .
 For ~10kb noisy reads sequences, minimap2 is tens of times faster than
 mainstream long-read mappers such as BLASR, BWA-MEM, NGMLR and GMAP. It
 is more accurate on simulated long reads and produces biologically
 meaningful alignment ready for downstream analyses. For >100bp Illumina
 short reads, minimap2 is three times as fast as BWA-MEM and Bowtie2, and
 as accurate on simulated data. Detailed evaluations are available from
 the minimap2 paper or the preprint.

Package: mksh
Description-md5: 997cf3ba5af062861db4a241ef36c4ee
Description-en: MirBSD Korn Shell
 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and works as /bin/sh on
 Debian systems (use the /bin/lksh executable) and is a good rescue
 and initrd shell (consider the /bin/mksh-static executable).
 .
 The mksh binary is a complete, full-featured shell. It provides a
 “consistent across all platforms” guarantee, using 32-bit integers
 for arithmetics, possibly deviating from POSIX.
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against klibc,
 musl, or dietlibc (if they exist for that Debian architecture and
 are usable) and optimised for small code size, for example for use
 on initrd or initramfs images, installation or rescue systems.
 Except for omitting some features to be smaller, it is similar to
 the mksh binary otherwise. Note the exact feature set may differ
 depending on which C library was used to compile it.
 .
 The lksh binary is a script shell based on mksh intended to run old
 ksh88 and pdksh scripts, but not for interactive use. When used as
 /bin/sh it follows POSIX most closely, including use of the host’s
 “long” C data type for arithmetics. It also contains kludges so it
 can run as /bin/sh on Debian beyond what Policy dictates, to work
 around bugs in maintainer scripts and LSB init scripts shipped by
 many packages, such as including a rudimentary printf(1) builtin,
 permitting a shell function to be named stop overriding the default
 alias, more loose interpretation of shell extglobs, etc.
 .
 A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
 provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
 /etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.
 .
 Built using dietlibc (= 0.34~cvs20160606-6), gcc-6 (= 6.3.0-18+deb9u1), klibc (= 2.0.4-9), linux (= 4.9.144-3), musl (= 1.1.16-3)

Package: python-mockldap
Description-md5: 23de8b6d7d5be802e30ecd53adf42851
Description-en: simple mock implementation of python-ldap (Python2 version)
 This project provides a mock replacement for python-ldap. It’s useful for any
 project that would like to write unit tests against LDAP code without relying
 on a running LDAP server.
 .
 The goal of mockldap is to provide a mock instance of LDAPObject in response to
 any call to ldap.initialize. In the general case, you would register return
 values for all LDAPObject calls that you expect the code under test to make.
 Your assertions would then verify that the tested code behaved correctly given
 this set of return values from the LDAP APIs.
 .
 As a convenience, the mock LDAPObject isn’t just a dumb mock object. The
 typical way to use mockldap is to provide some static directory content and
 then let LDAPObject generate real return values. This will only work for simple
 LDAP operations–this obviously isn’t a complete Python LDAP server
 implementation–but those simple operations tend to cover a lot of cases.

 .
 Most elements in MuseScore are laid out automatically on a “virtual note
 sheet”, with a near professional-quality layout engine, but can also be
 positioned manually, giving you total control of every score element’s
 position. The capabilities of MuseScore can be extended via plugins and
 extensions, and the growing repository on musescore.org contains many
 plugins submitted by users and an active development team.
 .
 MuseScore includes a set of sounds that reproduce common instruments (as
 defined by General MIDI) without taking up a lot of disk space or memory
 providing full orchestral and band sounds (with the Drumline extension
 installed this includes marching percussion). The general (non-Drumline)
 sound font is available as musescore-general-soundfont Debian package,
 if you wish to reuse it with other synthesisers.) You can also load any
 sound font you prefer for a wider variety of sounds or for more realism.
 .
 MuseScore can import and export MIDI and MusicXML files, and it can also
 import from Capella and several other programs. MuseScore can export to
 PDF, PNG, and other graphic formats, to WAV and other audio formats such
 as OGG Vorbis and MP3, or to GNU Lilypond for an alternative layout and
 print option.
 .
 MuseScore can upload scores to musescore.com, a score sharing site, and
 send scrolling sheet music videos to YouTube. In addition to the desktop
 software, you can rehearse “on the go” with MuseScore mobile apps (which
 do not support note entry, but many advanced playback functions). Note
 that all of these are commercial or otherwise non-free offers optionally
 integrated with, but not part of, the Free notation program. Scrolling
 video scores feature the notes highlighted in the score as they sound —
 and highlighted on a virtual piano keyboard below.

Description-en: General SoundFont from MuseScore (full version)
 This is the new standard hard disc space-saving SF3 format
 soundfont as shipped with MuseScore 2.2 and newer.
 .
 MuseScore_General attempts to keep the installed-size footprint
 low while providing the complete GM (General MIDI) sound set
 and some extras, although its full version is larger than its
 antecessor fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont because of the new focus
 on improving quality. (The small version is, despite restoring
 stereo samples for some instruments, actually smaller, thanks
 to numerous optimisations and bugfixes.)
 .
 The musescore-general-soundfont package contains everything at
 best quality; musescore-general-soundfont-small is only a fourth
 the size (about the same as fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont) while being
 a drop-in replacement (identical bank configuration) at comparable
 quality to the full soundfont, missing only the separate ensembles
 (using identical samples for e.g. first/second violin) and some of
 the new larger instrument samples. An SF2 (uncompressed) version
 ships in the musescore-general-soundfont-lossless package, for use
 by audiophiles, with synthesisers lacking SF3 support, or to avoid
 the long startup times of MuseScore.
 .
 It can be used with most modern MIDI synthesisers which support
 the SF3 format, although early implementations (such as the one
 from MuseScore before release 2.2) had bugs making the resulting
 sound bad; instead use fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont for those.
 .
 As it comes under the MIT licence, it can be used in most settings,
 but do remember that waveforms generated using this soundfont are
 “copies or substantial portions of the” soundfont.

Description-en: General SoundFont from MuseScore (uncompressed)
 This is the new standard soundfont as shipped with MuseScore 2.2
 and newer, in uncompressed SF2 format. It is significantly larger
 than the SF3 in the musescore-general-soundfont Debian package
 but identical, other than not compressing the samples with a
 lossy algorithm. This avoids audible Vorbis compression artefacts
 and the excessively long MuseScore startup time with compressed
 soundfonts.
 .
 MuseScore_General provides the complete GM (General MIDI) sound

 The SF3 SoundFont format is the same as SF2, except it uses
 an OGG container instead of WAV for the patches contained
 in it. Current synthesisers, such as MuseScore and FluidSynth,
 expect the Vorbis codec to be used, which is lossy; hence, an
 SF3 SoundFont is considered to have a corresponding SF2 one
 as source, and to be compiled via this tool.

 functions not available in the current MediaWiki, a
 MediaWikiVersionError is raised.
 .
 Most properties and generators accept the same parameters as the API,

 .
  * Image.imageinfo is the imageinfo of the latest image. Earlier

  * usercontribs is usercontributions
  * First parameters of search and usercontributions are search and
    user respectively
 .
 Properties and generators are implemented as Python generators. Their
 limit parameter is only an indication of the number of items in one
 chunk. It is not the total limit. Doing list(generator(limit =
 limit)) will return ALL items of generator, and not be limited by the
 limit value. Default chunk size is generally the maximum chunk size.

 .
 nxagent is a nested Xserver providing NX transport of X sessions. The
 application is based on the well known Xnest "nested" server. nxagent,
 like Xnest, is an X server for its own clients, and at the same time, an
 X client for a system's local X server.
 .
 The main scope of nxagent is to eliminate X round-trips or transform
 them into asynchronous replies. nxagent works together with nxproxy.
 nxproxy itself does not make any effort to minimize round-trips
 by itself, this is demanded of nxagent.
 .
 Being an X server, nxagent is able to resolve all the property/atoms related
 requests locally, ensuring that the most common source of round-trips are
 nearly reduced to zero.

Description-en: OpenConnect VPN server compatible with Cisco AnyConnect VPN
 OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be a
 secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the OpenConnect
 SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) compatibility with
 clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The OpenConnect VPN protocol
 uses the standard IETF security protocols such as TLS 1.2, and Datagram TLS to
 provide the secure VPN service. The server is implemented primarily for the
 GNU/Linux platform but its code is designed to be portable to other UNIX
 variants as well.
 .
 Ocserv's main feature is isolation of the VPN users from the main VPN server
 process. Each authenticated user is assigned an unprivileged worker process,
 and a networking (tun) device. That not only eases the control of the resources
 of each user or group of users, but also prevents privilege escalation due to
 any bug on the VPN handling (worker) server. Each VPN user can be authenticated
 using password, PAM, public key (in a smart card or not) or any combination of
 methods.

Description-en: Share a file over Tor Hidden Services anonymously and securely
 OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size with
 someone. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor
 hidden service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download
 the file. It doesn't require setting up a server on the Internet somewhere
 or using a third party filesharing service. You host the file on your own
 computer and use a Tor hidden service to make it temporarily accessible
 over the Internet. The other user just needs to use the Tor Browser and
 to enter the URL to download the file from you.

Description-md5: d767cb08238abbe08c2671b5e44f6d0b
Description-en: content-addressed filesystem for operating system binaries
 libostree provides a library and tools for managing bootable, immutable,
 versioned filesystem trees. It is like git in that it checksums
 individual files and has a content-addressed object store; unlike git,
 it "checks out" the files using hardlinks into an immutable directory
 tree. This can be used to provide atomic upgrades with rollback, history
 and parallel-installation, particularly useful on "fixed purpose"
 systems such as embedded devices.
 .
 This package contains the executables used to manage and create
 filesystem trees. It does not affect the boot process for the system
 on which it is installed.

Package: prometheus
Description-md5: 7f48f84a4177e99e795f6f034f9349c3
Description-en: Monitoring system and time series database
 Prometheus is a systems and services monitoring system. It collects metrics
 from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions,
 displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to
 be true.
 .
 Prometheus' main distinguishing features as compared to other monitoring
 systems are:
 .
  * A multi-dimensional data model (timeseries defined by metric name and set
    of key/value dimensions).
  * A flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality.
  * No dependency on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous.
  * Timeseries collection happens via a pull model over HTTP.
  * Pushing timeseries is supported via an intermediary gateway.
  * Targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration.
  * Multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support.
  * Federation support coming soon.

Description-en: cryptographic Python library (Python 2)
 PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
 cryptographic primitives.
 .
 PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
 with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
 for instance:
 .
   * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
   * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
   * First class support for PyPy
   * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
   * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * scrypt and HKDF
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
   * Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
   * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in
     userspace)
   * Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
   * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
   * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base
 .
 PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
 To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
 Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)
 are implemented as C extensions.

Package: pyfai
Description-md5: 99681480cbe1e9374e4e00c9c53fdf90
Description-en: Fast Azimuthal Integration scripts
 PyFAI is a Python library for azimuthal integration; it allows the conversion
 of diffraction images taken with 2D detectors like CCD cameras into X-Ray
 powder patterns that can be used by other software like Rietveld refinement
 tools (i.e. FullProf), phase analysis or texture analysis.
 .
 As PyFAI is a library, its main goal is to be integrated in other tools like
 PyMca, LiMa or EDNA. To perform online data analysis, the precise description
 of the experimental setup has to be known. This is the reason why PyFAI
 includes geometry optimization code working on "powder rings" of reference
 samples. Alternatively, PyFAI can also import geometries fitted with other
 tools like Fit2D.
 .
 PyFAI has been designed to work with any kind of detector with any geometry
 (transmission, reflection, off-axis, ...). It uses the Python library FabIO
 to read most images taken by diffractometer.

 This nagios compatible monitoring plugin will check available space and error
 statistics of a btrfs filesystem.
 .
 Traditional space usage monitoring based on the output of df is not sufficient
 when using btrfs. This plugin takes allocated but unused disk space, and
 unallocatable disk space (for example when mixing different sized disks with
 raid profiles) into account. It is meant to be used as an addition to using a
 regular disk usage plugin, based on df output.

 Additionally, the check keeps an eye on device error stats and will report if
 any of the counters (read errors, write errors, etc) of a device that is part
 of the filesystem is not zero.

Description-md5: 11497a5147980d5b11b3d8a1e2c5562c
Description-en: inject useful and sensible default behaviors into setuptools - Python 2.x
 PBR (Python Build Reasonableness) is a library that injects some useful and
 sensible default behaviors into your setuptools run. PBR can:
  * Manage version number based on git revisions and tags (Version file).
  * Generate AUTHORS file from git log
  * Generate ChangeLog from git log
  * Generate Sphinx autodoc stub files for your whole module
  * Store your dependencies in a pip requirements file
  * Use your README file as a long_description
  * Smartly find packages under your root package
 .
 PBR is only mildly configurable. The basic idea is that there's a decent way
 to run things and if you do, you should reap the rewards, because then it's
 simple and repeatable. If you want to do things differently, cool! But you've
 already got the power of Python at your fingertips, so you don't really need
 PBR.
 .
 PBR builds on top of the work that d2to1 started to provide for declarative
 configuration. d2to1 is itself an implementation of the ideas behind
 distutils2. Although distutils2 is now abandoned in favor of work towards PEP
 426 and Metadata 2.0, declarative config is still a great idea and
 specifically important in trying to distribute setup code as a library when
 that library itself will alter how the setup is processed. As Metadata 2.0 and
 other modern Python packaging PEPs come out, PBR aims to support them as
 quickly as possible.

Package: python-stetl
Description-md5: c29b79b652a8e1ea9a93e4bd3edae4a8
Description-en: Streaming ETL - Geospatial ETL framework for Python 2
 Stetl, streaming ETL, pronounced "staedl", is a lightweight ETL-framework
 for the conversion of rich (as GML) geospatial data conversion.
 .
 It basically glues together existing parsing and transformation tools
 like GDAL/OGR (ogr2ogr) and XSLT. By using native tools like libxml and
 libxslt (via Python lxml) Stetl is speed-optimized.
 .
 Stetl has a similar design as Spring (Java) and other modern frameworks
 based on IoC (Inversion of Control). A configuration file (in Python
 config format) specifies your chain of ETL steps. This chain is formed
 by a series of Python modules/objects and their parameters. These are
 symbolically specified in the config file. You just invoke etl.py the
 main program with a config file. The config file specifies the input
 modules (e.g. PostGIS), transformers (e.g. XSLT) and outputs (e.g. a GML
 file or even WFS-T a geospatial protocol to publish GML to a server).
 .
 This package contains the module for Python 2.

Description-md5: 6f5a453852ce090f81d8b33dfca3f1ab
Description-en: tools for transforming and inspecting PDF files
 QPDF is a program that can be used to linearize (web-optimize),
 encrypt (password-protect), decrypt, and inspect PDF files from the
 command-line.  It does these and other structural, content-preserving
 transformations on PDF files, reading a PDF file as input and
 creating a new one as output.  It also provides many useful
 capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people
 who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more
 about how they work.
 .
 QPDF understands PDF files that use compressed object streams
 (supported by newer PDF applications) and can convert such files into
 those that can be read with older viewers.  It can also be used for
 checking PDF files for structural errors, inspecting stream contents,
 or extracting objects from PDF files.  QPDF is not PDF content
 creation or viewing software -- it does not have the capability to
 create PDF files from scratch or to display PDF files.
 .
 This package includes the command-line qpdf tools.  It also contains
 the documentation.

Package: qrouter
Description-md5: 36eec188e75e1ca9afb5d31574ff67c0
Description-en: Multi-level, over-the-cell maze router
 Qrouter is a tool to generate metal layers and vias to physically connect
 together a netlist in a VLSI fabrication technology. It is a maze router,
 otherwise known as an "over-the-cell" router or "sea-of-gates" router. That
 is, unlike a channel router, it begins with a description of placed standard
 cells, usually packed together at minimum spacing, and places metal routes
 over the standard cells.
 .
 Qrouter uses the open standard LEF and DEF formats as file input and output.
 It takes the cell definitions from a LEF file, and analyzes the geometry for
 each cell to determine contact points and route obstructions. It then reads
 the cell placement, pin placement, and netlist from a DEF file, performs the
 detailed route, and writes an annotated DEF file as output.

Package: quilt
Description-md5: 8eeb0522bc56c3acd93b9e763f3dcd28
Description-en: Tool to work with series of patches
 Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
 each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
 apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack (push/pop).
 .
 Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a package received
 as a tarball or maintained in another version control system. The stacked
 organization is proven to be efficient for the management of very large patch
 sets (more than hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was designed by and
 for Linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm  branch, is the
 original author), and its main use by the current upstream maintainer is to
 manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel made for the SUSE
 distribution.
 .
 This package provides seamless integration into Debhelper or CDBS,
 allowing maintainers to easily add a quilt-based patch management system in
 their packages. The package also provides some basic support for those not
 using those tools. See README.Debian for more information.

Package: r-cran-bit
Description-md5: 1f7319050aa1386ab244caabc922c084
Description-en: GNU R class for vectors of 1-bit booleans
 This GNU R package provides bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs),
 coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; fast
 boolean operators and fast summary statistics. With 'bit' vectors you
 can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the expense of 1 bit
 only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less RAM and ~
 factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of R calls,
 actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains for
 vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations
 it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such
 components are used more than once.
 .
 Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing
 standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The
 package allows one to work with pre-allocated memory for return values
 by calling .Call() directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with
 pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to logical requires only
 70% of the time for copying from logical to logical; and copying from
 logical to bit comes at a performance penalty of 150%. the package now
 contains further classes for representing logical selections: 'bitwhich'
 for very skewed selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges of values for
 chunked processing. All three index classes can be used for subsetting
 'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).

Package: r-cran-bit64
Description-md5: e8cd547c29ff22fa3b9d0de8292fa529
Description-en: GNU R S3 Class for Vectors of 64bit Integers
 Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers.
 These are useful for handling database keys and exact counting in +-2^63.
 WARNING: do not use them as replacement for 32bit integers, integer64 are not
 supported for subscripting by R-core and they have different semantics when
 combined with double, e.g. integer64 + double => integer64.
 Class integer64 can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames.
 Methods are available for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles,
 characters and factors as well as many elementwise and summary functions.
 Many fast algorithmic operations such as 'match' and 'order' support
 interactive data exploration and manipulation and optionally leverage caching.

 cell to show details or drag a rectangle to zoom. A 'heatmap' is a
 popular graphical method for visualizing high-dimensional data, in which
 a table of numbers are encoded as a grid of colored cells. The rows and
 columns of the matrix are ordered to highlight patterns and are often
 accompanied by 'dendrograms'. 'Heatmaps' are used in many fields for
 visualizing observations, correlations, missing values patterns, and
 more. Interactive 'heatmaps' allow the inspection of specific value by
 hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into a region of the
 'heatmap' by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area. This work is
 based on the 'ggplot2' and 'plotly.js' engine. It produces similar
 'heatmaps' as 'heatmap.2' or 'd3heatmap', with the advantage of speed
 ('plotly.js' is able to handle larger size matrix), the ability to zoom
 from the 'dendrogram' panes, and the placing of factor variables in the
 sides of the 'heatmap'.

 This package aims at providing, first, shortcuts for statistical
 measures, which otherwise could only be calculated with additional
 effort (like standard errors or root mean squared errors). Second,
 these shortcut functions are generic (if appropriate), and can be
 applied not only to vectors, but also to other objects as well
 (e.g., the Coefficient of Variation can be computed for vectors,
 linear models, or linear mixed models; the r2()-function returns
 the r-squared value for 'lm', 'glm', 'merMod' or 'lme' objects).
 The focus of most functions lies on summary statistics or fit
 measures for regression models, including generalized linear
 models and mixed effects models. However, some of the functions
 also deal with other statistical measures, like Cronbach's Alpha,
 Cramer's V, Phi etc.

 A GNU R package for analysing spatial data, mainly Spatial Point Patterns,
 including multitype/marked points and spatial covariates, in any
 two-dimensional spatial  region.  Contains functions for plotting spatial
 data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, simulation, spatial sampling,
 model diagnostics, and formal inference. Data types include point patterns,
 line segment patterns, spatial windows, and pixel images. Point process
 models can be fitted to point pattern data.  Cluster type models are fitted
 by the method of minimum contrast. Very general Gibbs point process models
 can be fitted to point pattern data using a function ppm similar to lm or glm.
 Models may include dependence on covariates, interpoint interaction and
 dependence on marks. Fitted models can be simulated automatically.  Also

Package: racon
Description-md5: 0245f53dd68b53cce76f4a5dd8d8a554
Description-en: consensus module for raw de novo DNA assembly of long uncorrected reads
 Racon is intended as a standalone consensus module to correct raw
 contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a
 consensus step. The goal of Racon is to generate genomic consensus which
 is of similar or better quality compared to the output generated by
 assembly methods which employ both error correction and consensus steps,
 while providing a speedup of several times compared to those methods. It
 supports data produced by both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore
 Technologies.
 .
 Racon can be used as a polishing tool after the assembly with either
 Illumina data or data produced by third generation of sequencing. The
 type of data inputed is automatically detected.
 .
 Racon takes as input only three files: contigs in FASTA/FASTQ format,
 reads in FASTA/FASTQ format and overlaps/alignments between the reads
 and the contigs in MHAP/PAF/SAM format. Output is a set of polished
 contigs in FASTA format printed to stdout. All input files can be
 compressed with gzip.
 .
 Racon can also be used as a read error-correction tool. In this
 scenario, the MHAP/PAF/SAM file needs to contain pairwise overlaps
 between reads including dual overlaps.
 .
 A wrapper script is also available to enable easier usage to the end-
 user for large datasets. It has the same interface as racon but adds
 two additional features from the outside. Sequences can be subsampled
 to decrease the total execution time (accuracy might be lower) while
 target sequences can be split into smaller chunks and run sequentially
 to decrease memory consumption. Both features can be run at the same
 time as well.

Description-en: fast JSON parser/generator for C++ with SAX/DOM style API
 RapidJSON is an attempt to create the fastest JSON parser and generator.
 .
  - Small but complete. Supports both SAX and DOM style API. SAX parser only a
    few hundred lines of code.
  - Fast. In the order of magnitude of strlen(). Optionally supports
    SSE2/SSE4.2 for acceleration.
  - Self-contained. Minimal dependency on standard libraries. No BOOST, not
    even STL.
  - Compact. Each JSON value is 16 or 20 bytes for 32 or 64-bit machines
    respectively (excluding text string storage). With the custom memory
    allocator, parser allocates memory compactly during parsing.
  - Full RFC7159 compliance. Supports UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
  - Support both in-situ parsing (directly decode strings into the source JSON
    text) and non-destructive parsing (decode strings into new buffers).
  - Parse number to int/unsigned/int64_t/uint64_t/double depending on input
  - Support custom memory allocation. Also, the default memory pool allocator
    can also be supplied with a user buffer (such as a buffer allocated on
    user's heap or programme stack) to minimize allocation.

 Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a
 previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential
 maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by
 seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners
 by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550
 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server,
 while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In
 addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
 discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is
 also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454
 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons,
 the authors experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice
 junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision

 Language detection: ruby-github-linguist defines a list of all languages
 known to GitHub in a yaml file. In order for a file to be highlighted, a
 language and a lexer must be defined there.
 .
 Syntax Highlighting: The actual syntax highlighting is handled by the
 Pygments wrapper, ruby-pygments.rb. It also provides a Lexer abstraction that
 determines which highlighter should be used on a file.
 .
 Stats: The Language stats bar that you see on every repository is built by
 aggregating the languages of each file in that repository. The top language in
 the graph determines the project's primary language.
 .
 Ignore vendored files: Checking other code into your git repo is a common
 practice. But this often inflates your project's language stats and may even
 cause your project to be labeled as another language. ruby-github-linguist is
 able to identify some of these files and directories and exclude them.
 .
 Generated file detection: Not all plain text files are true source files.
 Generated files like minified js and compiled CoffeeScript can be detected and
 excluded from language stats. As an extra bonus, these files are suppressed in
 diffs.

Description-en: genomic sequence element (kmer) enrichment analysis
 Bacterial genomes vary extensively in terms of both gene content and
 gene sequence - this plasticity hampers the use of traditional SNP-based
 methods for identifying all genetic associations with phenotypic
 variation. SEER provides a computationally scalable and widely
 applicable statistical method for the identification of sequence
 elements that are significantly enriched in a phenotype of interest.
 SEER is applicable to even tens of thousands of genomes by counting variable-
 length k-mers using a distributed string-mining algorithm. Robust
 options are provided for association analysis that also correct for the
 clonal population structure of bacteria. Using large collections of
 genomes of the major human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, SEER
 identifies relevant previously characterised resistance determinants for
 several antibiotics.

Description-en: Salmonella serotyping from genome sequencing data
 SeqSero is a pipeline for Salmonella serotype determination from raw
 sequencing reads or genome assemblies.
 .
 SeqSero is a novel tool for determining Salmonella serotypes using high-
 throughput genome sequencing data. SeqSero is based on curated databases
 of Salmonella serotype determinants (rfb gene cluster, fliC and fljB
 alleles) and is predicted to determine serotype rapidly and accurately
 for nearly the full spectrum of Salmonella serotypes (more than 2,300
 serotypes), from both raw sequencing reads and genome assemblies. The
 performance of SeqSero was evaluated by testing
  1. raw reads from genomes of 308 Salmonella isolates of known serotype
  2. raw reads from genomes of 3,306 Salmonella isolates sequenced and
     made publicly available by GenomeTrakr, a U.S. national monitoring
     network operated by the Food and Drug Administration; and
  3. 354 other publicly available draft or complete Salmonella genomes.
 SeqSero can help to maintain the well-established utility of Salmonella
 serotyping when integrated into a platform of WGS-based pathogen
 subtyping and characterization.

Description-en: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 Its strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing pooled
    connections, constructing SQL from Python expressions, finding object
    instances, and committing object modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph of
    objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together to
    load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single result set;
    commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap out
    generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind parameters
    for all literal values, fully transactionalized and consistent updates
    using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of the
    rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and ORM. SQLAlchemy
    is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of customization, with
    an architecture that supports custom datatypes, custom SQL extensions, and
    ORM plugins which can augment or extend mapping functionality.

Description-en: mailbox synchronization tools
 Sync Mail Dir is a set of utilities to synchronize a pair of mailboxes
 in Maildir format, using SSH to transfer data. It provides the smd-pull
 utility to pull changes made on the remote mailbox, smd-push to propagate
 local changes to the remote mailbox, and smd-loop to iterate push and pull
 in a timely way.
 .
 The software is young and should thus be used with care in production
 environments.
 .
 Unlike OfflineIMAP, it does not require an IMAP server to be installed on the
 remote host. Moreover, it never attempts to automatically resolve conflicts
 between incompatible mailbox statuses - it just notifies the user explaining
 how to fix the problem.
 .
 Sync Mail Dir's design is similar to that of Maildirsync, but is more
 efficient in terms of CPU cycles and disk I/O.

 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Package: libtermbox-dev
Description-md5: d2bda16733106a99d54e7f9293777fd4
Description-en: Library for writing text-based user interfaces (dev)
 Termbox is a library that provides minimalistic API which allows the
 programmer to write text-based user interfaces.
 .
 It is based on a very simple abstraction. The main idea is viewing terminals
 as a table of fixed-size cells and input being a stream of structured
 messages. Would be fair to say that the model is inspired by windows console
 API. The abstraction itself is not perfect and it may create problems in
 certain areas.  The most sensitive ones are copy & pasting and wide characters
 (mostly Chinese, Japanese, Korean (CJK) characters). When it comes to copy &
 pasting, the notion of cells is not really compatible with the idea of text.
 And CJK runes often require more than one cell to display them nicely. Despite
 the mentioned flaws, using such a simple model brings benefits in a form of
 simplicity. And KISS principle is important.
 .
 At this point one should realize, that CLI (command-line interfaces) aren't
 really a thing termbox is aimed at. But rather pseudo-graphical user
 interfaces.
 .
 This package ships with headers and static library.

Package: tmux
Description-md5: dc6ff920cb9183a42694d0ea54835078
Description-en: terminal multiplexer
 tmux enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and
 controlled from a single terminal like screen. tmux runs as a
 server-client system. A server is created automatically when necessary
 and holds a number of sessions, each of which may have a number of
 windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session,
 or the server may be controlled by issuing commands with tmux.
 Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in /tmp.
 Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key
 binding, or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key
 layouts.

Package: tnseq-transit
Description-md5: ed6ccc42fdb3924f7848894e28b09ade
Description-en: statistical calculations of essentiality of genes or genomic regions
 This is a software that can be used to analyze Tn-Seq datasets. It
 includes various statistical calculations of essentiality of genes or
 genomic regions (including conditional essentiality between 2
 conditions). These methods were developed and tested as a collaboration
 between the Sassetti lab (UMass) and the Ioerger lab (Texas A&M)
 .
 TRANSIT is capable of analyzing TnSeq libraries constructed with Himar1
 or Tn5 datasets.
 .
 TRANSIT assumes you have already done pre-processing of raw sequencing
 files (.fastq) and extracted read counts into a .wig formatted file.
 The .wig file should contain the counts at all sites where an insertion
 could take place (including sites with no reads). For Himar1 datasets
 this is all TA sites in the genome. For Tn5 datasets this would be all
 nucleotides in the genome.

Package: libtcnative-1
Description-md5: e84963f196d386a9d69b251a5bf67a6e
Description-en: Tomcat native library using the Apache Portable Runtime
 Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability,
 performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
 The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the
 heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to
 advanced IO functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level
 functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native
 process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
 .
 These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will
 enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and
 overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform
 rather than simply a backend focused technology.

Package: tor
Description-md5: 9106e8e4b3843ebd532ba2b89615a92e
Description-en: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Description-md5: d0b50c9cd91157b8c85856fd55e26d14
Description-en: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

Package: xul-ext-torbirdy
Description-md5: eb753171d915a358e3b44479f858b66c
Description-en: configures and enhances various Mozilla birds for anonymity use
 The TorBirdy extension configures Thunderbird (or Icedove, etc) to make
 connections over the Tor anonymity network. It also takes steps to protect
 anonymity at the application level by reducing unique identifiers, disabling
 unsafe plugins, disabling insecure protocols, helpfully configuring other
 software such as Enigmail and GnuPG in anonymity protecting ways and more. It
 also helps to ease configuration with other anonymity networks and proxies such
 as JonDos.

Package: tp-smapi-dkms
Description-md5: 133901af24ac2f7f85a04a1d2ebd202c

Package: tup
Description-md5: 37d97ee5af776ca2ce6ff73cfb41869e
Description-en: fast build system
 Tup is a file-based build system for Linux, OSX, and Windows. It
 takes as input a list of file changes and a directed acyclic graph
 (DAG). It then processes the DAG to execute the appropriate commands
 required to update dependent files. Updates are performed with very
 little overhead since tup implements powerful build algorithms to
 avoid doing unnecessary work. This means you can stay focused on your
 project rather than on your build system.

Package: libunsafe-fences-java
Description-md5: 3e083c35292e0d5cff750122e0fbd1f0
Description-en: wrapper library around the Java 8 fences API
 unsafe-fences is a very simple Java library that just provides a shim
 around the Java 8 Unsafe methods used for memory fencing.
 .
 In Java 8, three memory-ordering intrinsics were added to the
 sun.misc.Unsafe class: fullFence, storeFence, and loadFence.
 .
 The main goal of unsafe-fences is to allow code in Java 6 and 7
 to compile those calls with a provided boolean guard.
 .
 This is especially useful for projects like JRuby that support
 several JDK versions but it can be reused by other Java projects as
 well.

Package: volatility
Description-md5: 4b32ecafb8984d5447ca6fa3901e4281
Description-en: advanced memory forensics framework
 The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools for
 the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
 It is useful in forensics analysis. The extraction techniques are
 performed completely independent of the system being investigated but
 offer unprecedented visibility into the runtime state of the system.
 .
 Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
 versions and service packs. Whether your memory dump is in raw format,
 a Microsoft crash dump, hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot,
 Volatility is able to work with it.
 .
 Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format are supported too. There are
 several plugins for analyzing memory dumps from 32- and 64-bit Linux
 kernels and relevant distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE,
 RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, etc.
 .
 Volatility also support several versions of Mac OSX memory dumps, both
 32- and 64-bit. Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.
 .
 These are some of the data that can be extracted from a memory image:
    - Image information (date, time, CPU count);
    - Running processes;
    - Open network sockets and connections;
    - OS kernel modules loaded;
    - Memory maps for each process;
    - Executables samples;
    - Command history;
    - Suspicious process mappings (i.e. injected code);
    - Passwords, as LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets;
    - Cached Truecrypt passphrases;
    - Others.
 .
 Current version (2.6) supports investigations of the memory images from
 the following operational systems:
    - 32-bit Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3
    - 32-bit Windows 2003 Server Service Pack 0, 1, 2

 For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
 access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or
 AppArmor rules), and instead given access to the listening Unix socket
 created by the proxy (typically by bind-mounting it into a Linux
 container).

 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.

 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.

 xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
 desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
 to provide its functionality.

 .
  * uses Mako templates instead of Jinja, for more programmatic capabilities
    inside of templates
  * layout includes an independently scrollable sidebar
  * unique (to Sphinx) “contextual” sidebar contents that shows the current
    page in context with all sibling pages
  * modifications to autodoc which illustrate inherited classes, bases, method
    documentation illustrates if a method is only inherited from the base or
    overridden
  * “dynamic base” feature that will, under ReadTheDocs, pull in optional
    .mako and .py files from the website of your choice that will serve as an
    alternate base template and a source of extra config setup, respectively,
    allowing the layout to be integrated into the layout of an external site
    when viewing on the web
  * “viewsource” extension that can provide highlighted sourcecode to any
    Python file arbitrarily
  * SQLAlchemy-specific stuff, like the [SQL] popups, the dialect info
    directives
  * scss support using pyscss
