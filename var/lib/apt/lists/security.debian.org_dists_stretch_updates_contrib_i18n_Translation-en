Package: python-django-anymail
Description-md5: 4a3d34c6b1fbe84cfad7a22770f68fcf
Description-en: Django email backend for multiple ESPs (Python 2)
 Anymail integrates several transactional email service providers (ESPs) into
 Django, with a consistent API that lets you use ESP-added features without
 locking your code to a particular ESP.
 .
 It currently fully supports Mailgun, Postmark, SendGrid, and SparkPost, and
 has limited support for Mandrill.
 .
 Anymail normalizes ESP functionality so it "just works" with Django's
 built-in `django.core.mail` package. It includes:
 .
   * Support for HTML, attachments, extra headers, and other features of
     Django's built-in email
   * Extensions that make it easy to use extra ESP functionality, like tags,
     metadata, and tracking, with code that's portable between ESPs
   * Simplified inline images for HTML email
   * Normalized sent-message status and tracking notification, by connecting
     your ESP's webhooks to Django signals
   * "Batch transactional" sends using your ESP's merge and template features
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
